As you may have noticed, we've recently added a stack, Cybele, and changed the name of our existing stack to Aurora. The two stacks are [slightly different](https://docs.snap-ci.com/the-ci-environment/stacks/), details below:

| Aurora                           | Cybele                               |
|----------------------------------|:------------------------------------:|
| Pre-existing stack               | New stack                            |
| CentOS 6-based build environment | Ubuntu 14.04-based build environment |  
| No Docker support                | Docker support                       |  

Both Aurora and Cybele are named after goddesses: Aurora was the Roman goddess of the dawn. She would ride every morning, ahead of the sun, to let light to the world. Her light would be the first you'd see (if you were a Roman) so it's fitting she's the namesake for our earlier stack.

Cybele (pronounced SEH'-bell-ee) on the other hand, was a mother-goddess figure whose worship started around 500 BC near Turkey and migrated to Rome and Greece. Cybele was often depicted in a chariot pulled by lions, and was often equated with Mother Earth herself. Cybele held power over the Earth's fertility and growth, so we hope the stack we've named after her will help our users grow as well.

It's no coincidence that both stacks are named after female figures. The Snap team is comprised nearly equally of males and females, and our parent company, ThoughtWorks, has taken [many measures](http://www.afr.com/it-pro/taking-out-tokenism-why-some-people-are-changing-their-minds-on-quotas-20130306-jyfd0?mkt_tok=3RkMMJWWfF9wsRokvqrJZKXonjHpfsX56%2BUsXKexlMI%2F0ER3fOvrPUfGjI4DScpkI%2BSLDwEYGJlv6SgFS7nMMbFk37gPUhA%3D) to increase diversity and inclusion across all positions.
We hope this sheds some light on why we chose the stack names we did. If you are not yet on Cybele but would like to be, please [contact Snap support](mailto:support@snap-ci.com).
