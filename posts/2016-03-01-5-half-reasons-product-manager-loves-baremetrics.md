I’m going to tell you why Baremetrics is an awesome reporting tool for SaaS product managers

## Reason 1: Easy to set up and get started
Seriously... you sync Stripe and it’s done. No more setup needed.

## Reason 2: Reports with no configuration
I get subscription-based metrics such as monthly recurring revenue, churn, new customer counts, plan-specific data and much more without doing anything. It’s to metrics like [Mint](https://www.mint.com/) is to personal finances. Plug, play and learn.

## Reason 3: Responsive support
They use [Intercom](https://www.intercom.io/) (another great tool for Product people and users alike) and are on-hand to help their users. They even chatted to me on the phone and asked for my feedback. Silly, I know, given that’s what all product creators should be doing, yet it's actually quite rare.

## Reason 4: Simple out-of-the-box forecasting.
Ok, so it’s probably not going to get me through the next quarter's financial planning, but their forecasting using current trends is a great way for me to see what the future is most likely going to look like. I move to Google docs to tweak the edges.

## Reason 5: SaaS-y content
They run a SaaS business, too. They share their learning on their blog. While some of it is not relevant to Snap CI's business, it's very useful to see and hear other people’s experiences. By using their own Baremetrics reports in their [blog posts](https://baremetrics.com/blog/freemium-saas-implode), it’s really easy to learn what to look for in our business as well. Plus, they [tell it like it is](https://baremetrics.com/blog/freemium-saas-implode).

## Reason 5.5: Time and energy savings
Of course I have a list of things I want them to do to save me more time and energy, such as customizable date ranges, a customizable dashboard, plan settings that stick, and plan ratio numbers, just to name a few. Because I’m a passionate user, and a product person, I have needs that still not being meet. Despite that, I am super happy with the time and energy I have saved so far. On balance, I’ll deduct half a bullet point for this one, just to manage your expectations. It’s not a [moon on a stick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERDUbAv8Qz0) after all!

So I just told you why Baremetrics was an awesome reporting tool for SaaS product managers. Why not tell me some other tools should I be using?
