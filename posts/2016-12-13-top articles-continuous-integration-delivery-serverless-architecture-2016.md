We’ve compiled our top 10 articles from 2016. Our [serverless architecture](https://blog.snap-ci.com/categories/serverless-architecture/) series was extremely popular, along with tips on faster deployments, how we compare to Jenkins, and how different people define CI and CD terms. We’ve learned a lot, and are excited to bring more tips, tricks, and trends to you in the new year.
