## ThoughtWorks' Continuous Delivery Products Snap CI and GoCD Come Together at the DevOps Enterprise Summit 2015 to Showcase Innovation in Continuous Delivery

SAN FRANCISCO, CA ­­ GoCD and Snap CI, products of ThoughtWorks, will join other software thought leaders in co­sponsoring the 2015 DevOps Enterprise Summit.

Taking place October 19­21, 2015 at the Hyatt Regency Hotel in San Francisco, the DevOps Enterprise Summit is the industry's leading DevOps and Continuous Delivery event. DOES15 is the event dedicated to those bringing Lean principles into the IT value stream while building DevOps and Continuous Delivery into their organization.

> "ThoughtWorks has been at the forefront of Continuous Delivery adoption since 2010 when former ThoughtWorkers Jez Humble and David Farley published the first book on > > Continuous Delivery," said Technical Evangelist Ken Mugrage. "Both GoCD and Snap CI continue that spirit of innovation in their product design, always creating new and > improved ways for customers to make their releases more reliable and more frequent."

Currently, ThoughtWorks offers both on-premise and cloud-based Continuous Delivery solutions. GoCD is free, open­source and specializes in advanced deployments. Snap CI is cloud­based, taking hardware out of the equation while offering a reliable feedback loop. Deployment pipelines are at the core of both products and offer visibility to the entire team.
