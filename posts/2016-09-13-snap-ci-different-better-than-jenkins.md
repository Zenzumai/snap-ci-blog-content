We know that you take pride in your software, and getting that great stuff to your customers is priority number one. We totally understand. We're a little biased, but we think Snap CI is the best choice for you when it comes to continuous integration and continuous deployment tools. Need convincing? Read on.

Here are three compelling reasons why fast-moving, successful software development teams like you are choosing Snap CI for continuous integration and continuous deployment over tools like Jenkins.

# Less tool admin means more time to do great stuff

There are huge benefits to be had by using a cloud-based continuous integration and deployment tool over an on-premise solution. First of all, the installation process is *much* less painful (e.g. no machines to acquire, so no overhead). Secondly, Snap takes care of maintaining and upgrading the system. We handle system updates, security patches, maintenance releases, etc. Phew.

In contrast, teams are often forced to have a “build” person when using on-premise solutions like Jenkins--basically, someone on the team who "owns" the Jenkins server. The tinkerer. The person with magic abilities who kicks the box in just the right place and gets it working. Of course that person’s time is expensive and this is not their day job... but you have to have them because when they are not around it can be a total nightmare. By using a cloud-based CI tool like Snap, you make us responsible for all that painful maintenance. So you have more time for coding, and we take care of the rest. You're welcome.


# You work with GitHub and so does Snap  

From the super-swift setup, to collaborator permissions and pull releases, Snap works just like you’d expect, making it a simple and easy to use choice for GitHub users.

With specific features like support for pull requests, automatic branch tracking and integration pipelines, Snap does more than just *work with* GitHub. We add Snap’s CI and CD magic to GitHub’s features, giving you feedback on whether a pull request passes, branches are green, and merges are good to go to release.


# CI/CD pipelines just work

Unlike Jenkins, which is a general automation tool with plugins to do CI/CD, Snap is specifically built to help software engineers practice continuous integration and continuous deployment. We have native out-of-the-box CI/CD deployment pipelines that were built to specifically help people like you get feedback on your code and release rapidly and regularly. There are no plugins, there are no special configs, you don’t need to RTFM or attend a conference. You don’t need prior experience or to consult the community to get your CI/CD pipeline working. It's ready from step one because that's what Snap was made to do. 


# But… but…!

Not convinced yet? Got some burning questions or “Yeah, but...” thoughts running through your head right now? Of course you do. I'll try to address a few of them.

#### But... Jenkins is free!

I know. Jenkins is free. Free as in beer. F-R-E-E. It’s true. But is it *really* free? Seriously. Read point number one ("Less admin") of this blog post again. To use this "free" tool, you need: a dedicated machine to run Jenkins on, someone to set it up, someone to maintain it, and someone to upgrade it. That’s four non-free things already and I didn’t even try that hard. So I agree Jenkins is free and free just like beer. It’s seems a good idea at the time, but in reality, too much of it is just painful.

#### But... Jenkins 2.0 has CI/CD pipelines!

Yes, Jenkins has marketed that Jenkins 2.0 has CI/CD pipeline support. Yet there is little evidence that Jenkins and the Jenkins community are making continuous deployment a top priority. For example - common best practices for continuous deployment such as “build an artifact once only” are either impossible to implement in Jenkins or can only be cobbled together with fragile combinations of plugins. So yeah, [“there’s a plugin for that”](http://grimoire.ca/dev/whats-wrong-with-jenkins) is always true for Jenkins. And yes, in theory, you can indeed do continuous delivery and continuous deployment on Jenkins, *if* you understand all the Jenkins plugins, mix and match them, stumble upon the correct combinations, wrangle it to do everything you want, and then work to maintain that delicate sequence. But is that really what you want to spend your time and effort on? We at Snap certainly don't!


# Simply what you need

So where does this leave us? Simply put, we have tried to make Snap CI the simplest, easiest continuous integration and continuous deployment tool out there. It's the solution for software engineering teams who want to spend their time coding, solving problems, building software and releasing code quickly and efficiently. If you want a best-of-breed tool designed specifically to help you integrate and deploy continuously, Snap CI will work for you. For teams who want to manage CI servers, becomes experts in a CI tool, work with clunky interfaces, play Lego with a bunch of plugins, Google forever to get answers, or create the world’s most intricate deployment pipeline - there’s other tools like Jenkins.

By the way, if I’m wrong about something in this post, or I missed a “yeah but...” please comment and let me know. I'd love to understand how we can make Snap CI even better for you.
