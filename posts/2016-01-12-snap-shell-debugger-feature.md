## Use the Snap Shell feature directly from your failed pipeline stage

Want to quickly investigate a stage failure? Changing the configuration and having a whole pipeline run again can be cumbersome and time consuming. Snap provides stage debug rerun functionality which aims to help you understand the cause of stage failure fast. Debugging in Snap gives you an understanding--quickly--of what went wrong, without having to make any build configuration changes. This helps you get back to green builds faster.

Watch this quick video on how to use the <a href="https://docs.snap-ci.com/getting-started/debugger/">Snap Shell for debugging</a>.
