## ThoughtWorks doesn't just talk Continuous Delivery best practices: it supports them by creating powerful build-and-deploy tools and sponsoring forward-looking events like DevOpsDays

SAN FRANCISCO, March 30, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- GoCD and Snap CI, products of ThoughtWorks, will join other software thought leaders in co-sponsoring several [DevOpsDays in 2016](http://www.devopsdays.org/).

The first event to kick off 2016 will take place in Vancouver, Canada on April 15th, and will include Austin, Salt Lake City, Seattle, [and more](https://snap-ci.com/lp-3060aee13b/snap-ci-events-2016/).

"ThoughtWorks has been at the forefront of Continuous Delivery adoption since 2010 when former ThoughtWorkers Jez Humble and David Farley published the first book on Continuous Delivery," said Technology Evangelist Ken Mugrage. "Both GoCD and Snap CI continue that spirit of innovation in their product design, always creating new and improved ways for customers to make their releases more reliable and more frequent."

>ThoughtWorks aims to push software development teams to think and work differently. We were leaders in continuous integration and created the first continuous integration server, Cruise Control, in 2001. From there, we pushed the boundaries of CI into what would become Continuous Delivery. We've been working to make Continuous Delivery common practice for the last decade. We didn't just write the book on Continuous Delivery. We also made the best build and deployment pipelines for on-premise and cloud in GoCD and Snap.
