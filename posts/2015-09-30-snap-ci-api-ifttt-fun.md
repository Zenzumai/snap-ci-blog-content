<span style="font-style:italic">Who says you can't have fun doing Continuous Delivery? Snap user and fellow ThoughtWorker, Marco Valtas, recently designed a deploy button for pushing to production.</span>

Snap CI updated its APIs a while ago and I didn't have chance to try them. But then recently I found [IFTTT Do Button](https://ifttt.com/products/do/button) so I thought, "What about a deploy button for Snap?" Well, here it is:

## Fun Goldberg Machine with @snap_ci and IFTTT

It's a sort of a [Goldberg Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rube_Goldberg_machine), but fun. Basically what happens is:

* A script monitors a folder on Dropbox with fswatch
* A recipe to create a file in Dropbox is triggered through Do Button.
* The script detects the event and uses Snap-CI API to trigger a manual stage.

### Here's the script:

For this script to work you need [fswatch](https://github.com/emcrisostomo/fswatch), [jq](http://stedolan.github.io/jq/) and [cURL](http://curl.haxx.se/). Note that I save my API key in my keychain. If you're not using a Mac, you need to figure a way to keep it a secret.
